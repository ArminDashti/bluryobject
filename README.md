I know I'm a junior in the Machine Learning field. so maybe this project is not perfect. Please let me know if I'm wrong.
I used Pytorch library and OpenCV for for making this project.

This is brief of my project:
1- Downloaded fasterrcnn_mobilenet_v3_large_320_fpn 
2- Used OpenCV to seprate frames from video. 
3- Passed each frame to pre_process_image function.
4- Feeded each frame to the mobilenet model and get result.
5- Aggregation all frames to a video file.
